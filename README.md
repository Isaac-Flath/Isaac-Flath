# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist and data engineer with a varied background that likes doing varied things.

The breadth of roles I have done gave me lots of practice learning new things on the fly and so I have become very good at it.  It's also given me a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.
