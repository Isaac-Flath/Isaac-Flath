# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Data scientist and data engineer**  

Currently Working on:

    + Building Open Source Datasets 
    
        + [Python Data Pipelines](https://github.com/codenym/datapipelines):  The repo where the main data pipelines will live built using dagster and an s3 data lake
        + [ezduckdb python library](https://codenym.github.io/ezduckdb/):  Python library to assist with working with s3 data lake using duckdb.  Includes things like db connection management and querying and sql templating.
        + [GoDuck CLI tool written in Go](https://github.com/Codenym/GoDuck):  CLI useful for working with datalake.  Does things like convert templated sql files to runnable sql and create duckdb databases with data in datalake (either as reference or as table).
    + [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://isaac-flath.github.io/DataStructuresAlgorithms/):  I am working through the [neetcode roadmap](neetcode.io/roadmap)

            + Data Pipelines (Luigi, Airflow, Dagster)
            + Data Sources (web scraping, ftps, emails, apis)

I believe that spending a little time close to every day over a long period of time is extremely powerful and underated, both for professional and personal growth.  I track 3 - 5 things to do daily at any given point in time, here's the current ones!
