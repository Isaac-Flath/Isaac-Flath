# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist and data engineer with a varied background that likes doing varied things.  The breadth of roles I have done gave me lots of practice learning new things on the fly and so I have become very good at it.  It's also given me a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.

I am currently spending a lot of time developing data and software engineering skillsets as I work on some very cool personal project ideas.
