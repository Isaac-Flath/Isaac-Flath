# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist with a varied background that likes doing varied things.  My journey has been varied and unique.  

The breadth of roles I have done gives me a unique perspective, experience learning new things on the fly under pressure, and a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.
